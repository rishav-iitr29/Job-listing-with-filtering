## My process
I started by building the page using HTML and then styled a static page with CSS. Then I used JS to generate HTML from data.json and add some functionality in it. Later I used media query for responsive design on smaller screens (around 768px).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS

### What I learned

- Used fetch() to load JSON data dynamically
- Handling filtering logic and state

### Continued development

I mainly want to work upon some backend as well in my next project and also figure out the use of APIs

### Useful resources

- https://supersimpledev.github.io/references/html-css-reference.pdf - This reference pdf helped me find out syntax of functions I didn't clearly remembered
